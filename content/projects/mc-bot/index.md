[Minecraft-Discord-Bot] is a small Discord bot allowing you to control a minecraft server from a discord server.

## Features

- It can start/stop the server
- Check the server status (num of players, etc)
- Inject commands as the server console (using `rcon`)
- *Some lightning strikes*

## Why even make it?

When you host a Minecraft server, it doesn't make sense for the game to be running all the time. So I needed to have a mechanism to allow my friends to turn on the server when needed and for them to be able to turn it off after playing. Existing solutions were either too complicated, or just didn't exist in the way that I wanted them to, so I created this bot. It does its job well and is adaptable to many different setups (I switched to a container-oriented setup recently and the customized launched command really helps).

## Where can I find it?

**Go to the [Github page](https://github.com/TypicalAM/Minecraft-Discord-Bot) and see the installation instructions!**
