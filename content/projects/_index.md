**This is my portfolio.** Most of my projects are publicly available on my [Github](https://github.com/TypicalAM), but some of them aren't for example for security reasons, or that **i just didn't feel like it**. Most of the thingies are web-based although I do have some terminal ones, the most notable being `goread`.

A considerable behemoth of a project is the website that you are viewing this on! **Be sure to check out how this was made!**
