## Introduction

Cool aspects of hackathons that give my teams a big advantage, maybe something to take out of this

## The big three

Coding is important, but not the most important:
- IDEA***
    - How to validate an idea successfully (you are short on time)
- Coding
- Presentation

## Often overlooked

- Presentation
- Mentor help and guidance toward what they are looking for
- Deployment

## Product-based approach

You are selling product, don't do tech stuff, nobody cares about your 26-line SQL query

## Little things matter

Presentation and deployment are important
